echo "<pindel_directory>/pindel"
echo " "
echo "In this particular case: "
echo "../pindel"
echo "  "
echo " "
echo "To run Pindel on a BAM-file, use the following command: "
echo "<pindel_directory>/pindel -i <bam_config_file> -f <reference.fa> -o <output_prefix> -c <name_of_chromosome/ALL>"
echo "Note that the bam-files must have been indexed in advance with samtools index "
echo " " 
echo "In this particular case: "
echo "../pindel -i simulated_config.txt -f simulated_reference.fa -o bamtest -c ALL"
echo " "
echo " "
echo "Finally, one can run pindel on txt files out of bam-files created with bam2pindel. This option is not strictly needed as versions of pindel since 0.2.0 can read BAM files directly, this comparison of an actual tumor sample to its normal control gives an indication of Pindel\'s capabilities in research and clinical settings."
